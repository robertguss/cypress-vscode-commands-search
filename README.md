# Cypress Command Docs for VSCode

This extension makes it easy to look up any Cypress command in the official Cypress docs.

To look up a command, put the mouse cursor over a cypress command then press the `ctrl+h` keys. This will open up your default browser to the appropriate docs page for that specific command.
