# VSCode Cypress Docs Extension

This repo contains the source code for the Cypress Docs VSCode Extension.

## Features

This extension makes it very simple to look up any Cypress command in the official Cypress docs. By default the extension uses the keybinding `ctrl+h` to look up a command. To look up a command, put the mouse cursor over a cypress command then press the `ctrl+h` keys. This will then open up your default browser to the appropriate docs page for that specific command.
